	<p> I am mainly based in Seattle and live with my three kids, and my husband Derek Shepherd. We all share a love for ferry boats. I have always lived in Seattle and grew up in hospitals so surgery is very close to my heart. When I'm not spending time with my family or in the OR I also like to have fun with photoshop and programming. I am taking a computer science class right now, it's called JOC. I am also interested in research and new tech innovations, I recently research a try tool for a cosmetic company. Click "tech innovation" page for more. </p>
